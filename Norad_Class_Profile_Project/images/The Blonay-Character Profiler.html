        <p>The survey comprises 21 multiple choice questions. The answers to these questions will produce a character profile on three dimensions: Empathy, Bold creativity and Self-discipline. There are no right or wrong answers in the quiz; your total score for the three sections combined will be the same but some areas may have higher scores than others. We are looking at where within these three dimensions you sit most comfortably. And we believe that knowing this can help you relate to others who may sit more comfortably with a different profile.</p>
